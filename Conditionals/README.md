# Conditionals and Branching

When programming, we often want to make the computer do one of many possible things depending on the value of some variable or expression.

For example, imagine a user is submitting a form. If they're missing required form fields, display an error message and prompt them to fill in the missing information. Otherwise, save their submission and display a "Thank you!" screen. filled out all required forms, save their submission.

Each possible action a computer might take is called a "branch". You might hear a programming asking, "Which branch of this conditional statement is the computer executing?"
