# Numbers

JavaScript has a few core data types, which is calls "primitive" types. The first we'll deal with is `number`.

Open up a terminal and run the `node` command to get a node prompt.

Type — **don't copy!** — each of these lines one by one. Before you hit enter, make a prediction about what you'll see on the screen. Were your predictions correct?

```javascript
1 + 2
3 + 4

1 - 2
2 - 1

14 + 192
99.5 + 100.5
```

Try some examples on your own. See if you can't find anything surprising.

Again, type each line below, make a prediction about what you'll see, and hit enter. In code, we denote multiplication with `*` and division with `/`.

```javascript
1 * 2
2 * 10
15.5 * 4

8 / 2
10 / 2
10 / 3

5 / 2
2 / 5
```

## Extra Numerical Operations

Here are two operations that might not be obvious at first glance. See if you can't figure out what they do. Play around with different values.

The first operation is `**`:

```javascript
10**1
10**2
10**3
10**4

2**2
2**3
2**4
```

The second operation is `%`:

```javascript
5 % 2
5 % 3
5 % 4
5 % 5

10 % 2
10 % 3
10 % 4
10 % 5

20 % 18
```

What might `%` be doing? What happens if you use negative numbers?
