# Variables

Imagine your friend told you: "I'm going to hand you a piece of paper with two numbers written on it, call them `x` and `y`. I want you to take out a new piece of paper, write down the larger of `x` and `y`, and hand that new piece of paper back to me."

You would understand what to do without having to know the specific values of `x` and `y` when your friend was describing the task. You have in your mind some general way of finding the larger of *any* two numbers and don't need to know their literal values until the moment you have to perform the task.

**Variables** are what allow us to write code that does the same. Rather than always referring to data by its literal value (e.g., the number `5` or the string `'waffles'`), we can assign data to named variables and then write code that refers to those names.

You can think of variables like a sticky note with a label. Instead of saying "The number 4" we might say "The number written on the sticky note labeled 'age'." We can change what's written on the sticky note without having to change how we refer to it in code.
