# Collections

There are times when we want to deal with many values as a single collection rather than individually.

For example, imagine we're taking a series of temperature measurements. If we were doing it by hand, we'd have a log book, a thermometer, and a watch. Every time we took a new reading, we'd append a record to our log book. Each record would contain two pieces of information: a temperature and the time at which we took the temperature.

We might then hand off the book to someone else whose job it was to produce charts from our data. Or we might put the log book on a shelf until we returned weeks later to make some more temperature readings. The point is that the book itself is something we can pass around and manipulate.

When programming, there are many types of collections available to us depending on how we want to organize our information.

The two most common types of collections are

1. Arrays (or lists)
1. Dictionary (or associative array)

Most modern languages have built-in support for these types of collections and JavaScript is no exception. We'll discuss how these collections are below.
